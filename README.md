Battleship is a recreation of the classic battleship game. To improve understanding of object-oriented design, students in the class were assigned with using the given skeleton to create a fully functional game. Students also had to implement 3 versions of AI battleship players: badplayer, mediocreplayer, and goodplayer, with students creating their own goodplayer algorithm that was expected to beat mediocreplayer the majority of the time. Allowed students to practice usage of data structures and objects from inheritance.
